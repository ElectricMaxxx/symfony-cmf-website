    Its quite an exciting time for the CMF, there is talk about the next
    generation of Jackalope, the Resource stack, rewriting the
    TreeBrowserBundle and true multi-site support.

    We also had a CMF hackday in December at the Mayflower offices in Würzburg, Germany and we are
    hoping to have another one in the coming months. If you are interested make your self known
    on the [CMF Mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/symfony-cmf-devs), otherwise
    we will announce it on the [@SymfonyCMF](http://twitter.com/SymfonyCMF) Twitter account.

    ### Jackalope 2.0
    
    It has been generally agreed that the current Jackalope implementation
    could be improved upon, and to this end the architecture should be adapted.

    The current Jackalope implementation was originally intended only to be a
    client for Apache Jackrabbit, the `doctrine-dbal` implementation was an
    afterthought.

    Jackalope will be refactored with the aim of providing a modular framework which
    will support multiple native persistence backends (Doctrine DBAL, filesystem, MongoDB) in
    addition to support for Jackrabbit.

    Modules will also be provided for versioning and search. For versioning there will be support
    for GIT, database storage and Jackrabbit. Search modules will initially be provided for
    Elastic Search and Zend Lucene.

    Work will probably begin at sometime in the second quarter of this year.

    ### Resources
    
    Resources are a new and experimental concept in the CMF. Resources are a
    common interface to disparate entities within the system. For example a
    resource could represent a file on the local filesystem, a Doctrine Entity
    or a PHPCR Node.

    The resource stack is built upon [Puli](https://github.com/puli/repository).

    Two of the greatest apparent benefits will be nice ways to support multiple
    sites and dynamic theming.

    See [this blog
    post](http://www.dantleech.com/post/2015/01/18/cmf-resource-s-and-puli-and-why-they-are-good)
    for more information.

    ### TreeBrowserBundle
    
    [WouterJ](https://twitter.com/WouterJNL) has been working on a new tree
    browser implementation for the
    [TreeBrowserBundle](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/TreeBrowserBundle).

    - The trees will be implemented as pure JS adapters to existing libraries.
    - Data will be retrieved from the
      [ResourceRestBundle](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/ResourceRestBundle).
    - The tree packages will be kept in a javascript package manager (e.g.
      [bower](http://bower.io)).

    As a result the code in the TreeBrowserBundle will be limited to
    bootstrapping the adapters.

    Integration with the resource API will also enable users to freely mix both
    Doctrine ORM resources and PHPCR-ODM resources in the same tree.

    ### SiteContextBundle
    
    [dantleech](https://twitter.com/dantleech) recently started working on a new SiteContextBundle.

    All CMS's that support multiple sites will undoubtably have some "site manager" service
    which listens to the incoming Request and determines which Site should be "loaded". This decision
    will normally be based upon the hostname.

    The SiteContextBundle will aim to provide a CMF solution to this problem and also provide an
    integration with the SonataAdminBundle.

    This bundle will provide the contextual information required by the resource stack to determine where
    to locate a sites resources (e.g. the routes, content, blocks, etc.).
