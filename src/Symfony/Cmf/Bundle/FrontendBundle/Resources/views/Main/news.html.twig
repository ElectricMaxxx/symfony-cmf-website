    <h3>Symfony CMF at the Create.js hackathon in Berlin</h3>
    <div class="subtitle"><a href="https://connect.sensiolabs.com/profile/lsmith">Lukas Kahwe Smith</a> – July 21, 2012</div>

    <p>
        The Symfony CMF has featured integration with create.js and VIE for inline editing for quite sometime
        already. As a matter of fact <a href="http://liip.ch">Liip</a> is one of the big contributors thanks to the
        <a href="http://blog.liip.ch/archive/2011/12/23/what-liip-did-after-winning-the-iks-semantics-ux-contest.html">UX design prize</a>
        Liip won showcasing our work integrating create.js into the Symfony CMF sandbox. David represented the CMF project
        at the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/createjs-hackathon-berlin/">hackathon in Berlin</a>. You can read some more
        information on <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/createjs-update/">what is going on with create.js</a> on Henri's blog.

    <h3>Jackalope Doctrine DBAL now compatible with PostgreSQL and SQLite</h3>
    <div class="subtitle"><a href="https://connect.sensiolabs.com/profile/lsmith">Lukas Kahwe Smith</a> – July 19, 2012</div>

    <p>
        Thanks to the work of <a href="https://github.com/cryptocompress">cryptocompress</a> the Jackalope
        test suite for the Doctrine DBAL implementation now also
        <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal">runs with PostgreSQL and SQLite</a>!
        Previously it only passed using MySQL for storage. This is a major milestone as once you can support 3
        so radically different RDBMS there is little doubt left that we cannot easily support others too. More
        importantly this was all done in a very short time frame and we now have worked around many of the
        special gotcha's of MySQL. As a result we expect that adding support for other RDBMS will only
        take a minimal amount of time.

    <h3>Symfony CMF sandbox now running with multiple different PHPCR implementations</h3>
    <div class="subtitle"><a href="https://connect.sensiolabs.com/profile/lsmith">Lukas Kahwe Smith</a> – June 12, 2012</div>

    <p>
        One of the fundamental ideas of PHPCR is that there can be multiple implementations that
        from an API act and behave exactly the same, but can be optimized for every different
        scalability and server requirements. We have been adding functional tests for the sandbox,
        but initially only tested using the <a href="https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit">Jackrabbit</a>
        based PHPCR implementation. In the past weeks we have now also
        <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/symfony-cmf/cmf-sandbox">enabled running the same tests</a>
        against the <a href="https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal">Doctrine DBAL</a> and
        <a href="http://midgard-project.org/phpcr/">Midgard</a> implementations. The key thing is
        that all we had to do was adjust the configuration, no code changes were necessary. This is
        the best validation of the concept of PHPCR possible! It proofs that the same code can run
        against now 3 different implementations of PHPCR!

    <h3>Symfony CMF featured on symfony.com</h3>
    <div class="subtitle"><a href="https://connect.sensiolabs.com/profile/lsmith">Lukas Kahwe Smith</a> – June 05, 2012</div>

    <p>
    David wrote a <a href="http://symfony.com/blog/the-symfony-content-management-framework-is-getting-ready#">blog post</a>
    for symfony.com on the current state of the Symfony CMF project.
    He also mentions the work that Frederic Haddad has been doing leveraging the CMF for his clients that
    he illustrates in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5Y5QPcYWHw">short video</a>. Looks
    like the Symfony CMF is ready for prime time!
