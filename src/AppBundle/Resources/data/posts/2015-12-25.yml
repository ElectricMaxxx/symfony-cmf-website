  Progress has not been as steady as we had hoped this year. Behind the scenes we have added several
  tweaks and improvements to the various Bundles and components and are working on Symfony 2.8
  and 3.0 support. Its not yet entirely clear if we will manage to support 3.0 right away though
  as it might be more feasible for us to do this only in new major versions which will require 2.8+.
  However for now we want to maintain compatibility with Symfony 2.3+ if possible until next spring.
  What is becoming clear however is that PHP 5.3 support is no longer a hard requirement for us. We
  will simply keep PHP 5.3 compatibility as a best as we can but will switch to PHP 5.4+ if we run
  into any tricky issues with 5.3.

  That being said, we also wanted to share the news that PHPCR ODM and DoctrinePHPCRBundle 1.3 have
  been released. The most important improvements are Symfony 3.0 compatibility while maintaining
  full compatibility with Symfony 2.3. Furthermore PHP 7.0 is fully supported. However this
  required a significant change: "Deprecated Binary, Boolean, Date, Decimal, Double, Float, Int,
  Long, Name, Path, String and Uri annotations in favor of `@Field(type="...")`." This means in
  order to make code compatible with PHP 7.0, one needs to switch all field annotation mappings
  to this new syntax as otherwise one will receive a fatal error as "string" etc are now resvered
  keywords.
