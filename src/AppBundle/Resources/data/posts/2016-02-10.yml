    The release of Symfony CMF 1.3 is coming closer with the availability of
    release candidates for all packages. Stable releases can be expected in the
    coming weeks.

    After the 1.2 release, the activity of the Symfony CMF project has dropped,
    resulting in no new release in 2014. With this new release, the CMF is back
    in the running with full Symfony 2.8 and PHP 7 support.

    ## Important new Features

    Included in this release are the following packages:

     * Version 1.0 of SlugifierApi;
     * Version 1.1 of RoutingAutoBundle and RoutingAuto;
     * Version 1.2 of SearchBundle, SeoBundle and TreeBrowserBundle;
     * Version 1.3 of BlockBundle, CoreBundle, ContentBundle, MediaBundle,
       SimpleCmsBundle, Testing;
     * Version 1.4 of RoutingBundle and Routing;
     * Version 2.0 of MenuBundle;

    The most important features included in these new versions are:

     * PHP 7 support for all CMF packages;
     * The Routing and Testing components support Symfony 3;
     * The CmfMenuBundle added KnpMenu 2 support and dropped support for KnpMenu 1;
     * The CmfSeoBundle added support for generating sitemaps and an exception
       controller for better error pages;
     * The CmfMediaBundle added a `cmf_media_file` form type to upload simple files;
     * Improved admin experience for most Sonata Admin classes;
     * A ``symfony-cmf/slugifier-api`` package was introduced, containing a
       generic sluggifier interface to be used when a sluggifier is needed;
     * Integration of CKeditor in the CmfSimpleCmsBundle and CmfContentBundle,
       providing the admin with better tooling to edit page contents.

    You can read about all new features [master version](http://symfony.com/doc/master/cmf)
    of the documentation.

    Please update your project and to test the release candidates. This will
    help making the 1.3 release more stable.

    ## The Future

    Symfony CMF 1.3 will be the last release in the 1.x series. After this
    release, work will start on Symfony CMF 2.0. This version targets Symfony
    2.8 and 3.0+. In 1.3, most deprecated features already trigger deprecation
    notices. However, this does not mean the upgrade to 2.0 will not contain
    more breaking changes. We do our best to reduce the breaking changes as
    much as possible.
