name: "release-1-3"
title: "Symfony CMF 1.3 Released"
publish_start_date: "2016-04-04"
body: |
    We released new stable versions of all CMF bundles, the standard edition
    and the sandbox. Most importantly, this release brings full support for
    up to Symfony 2.8 and PHP 7 support.

    ### Released Versions

    Included in this release are the following packages:

     * Version 1.0 of SlugifierApi;
     * Version 1.1 of RoutingAutoBundle and RoutingAuto;
     * Version 1.2 of SearchBundle, SeoBundle and TreeBrowserBundle;
     * Version 1.3 of BlockBundle, CoreBundle, ContentBundle, MediaBundle,
       SimpleCmsBundle, Testing;
     * Version 1.4 of RoutingBundle and Routing;
     * Version 2.0 of MenuBundle;

    The version numbers for each bundle are tracked separately, which explains
    why not all of them are synchronized.

    ### Important new Features

    The most important features included in these new versions are:

     * PHP 7 support for all CMF packages;
     * The Routing and Testing components support Symfony 3;
     * The CmfMenuBundle added KnpMenu 2 support and dropped support for KnpMenu 1;
     * The CmfSeoBundle added support for generating sitemaps and an exception
       controller for better error pages;
     * The CmfMediaBundle added a `cmf_media_file` form type to upload simple files;
     * Improved admin experience for most Sonata Admin classes, including integration
       of the [SonataTranslationBundle](https://sonata-project.org/bundles/translation/master/doc/index.html)
       for multi-language documents;
     * A ``symfony-cmf/slugifier-api`` package was introduced, containing a
       generic sluggifier interface to be used when a sluggifier is needed;
     * Integration of CKeditor in the CmfSimpleCmsBundle and CmfContentBundle,
       providing the admin with better tooling to edit page contents.

    You can read about all new features [master version](http://symfony.com/doc/master/cmf)

    ### The Future

    Symfony CMF 1.3 will be the last release in the 1.x series. After this
    release, work will start on Symfony CMF 2.0. This version targets Symfony
    2.8 and 3.0+. In 1.3, most deprecated features already trigger deprecation
    notices. However, this does not mean the upgrade to 2.0 will not contain
    more breaking changes. We do our best to reduce the breaking changes as
    much as possible.

    For 2.0, we will also try to reduce the number of bundles included in the
    CMF so that we can focus on the important parts. A first thing we already
    deprecated is the BlogBundle that never saw a stable release.

    A rough plan for 2.0 is in the [project wiki](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/symfony-cmf/wiki/Release-2.0).
